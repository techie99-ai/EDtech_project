- Basic department filtering dropdown
- Limited visual data representation
- Minimal actionable insights

## Requested Enhancements
Please design comprehensive solutions for the following priority features:

1. **Interactive Analytics Dashboard**
   - Design interactive metric widgets that expand to show detailed breakdowns
   - Create trend visualizations showing metrics over time (week/month/quarter)
   - Develop comparative views between departments and teams
   - Implement predictive analytics for learning completion forecasting

2. **Persona Intelligence Center**
   - Design visual representation of learner distribution across personas
   - Create persona engagement comparison tools

- Designs should allow for personalization based on admin preferences

## Deliverables
Please provide:
1. Wireframes/mockups for enhanced overview dashboard
2. Interactive prototype demonstrating key functionality
3. Technical specifications for development team
4. Implementation roadmap with prioritization recommendations
