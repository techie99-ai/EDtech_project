I already have a working base for my persona-based learning recommendation system website. I need you to rebuild or refactor it strictly using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no React, TypeScript, or any frameworks).

🔧 Key Requirements:
Do NOT use React, TypeScript, or any frontend frameworks.

Only use HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and vanilla JavaScript for logic and interactivity.

Structure the code clearly with separate files: index.html, style.css, and script.js (or modular JS files if needed).

✅ Features to Add or Fix:
Responsiveness & UI Enhancements

Make the entire site hyper-responsive across all screen sizes.

Add smooth transitions, animations, and if possible, 3D/parallax effects with CSS or JS.

Home Page

Redesign the homepage to be more visually clean and modern.

Only show key features like the Hero section and “Take the Persona Quiz” button before login.

Reveal all features only after login.

Login & Register Pages

Fix visibility issues: “Register” and “Sign In” buttons are not visible.

Ensure all form inputs and buttons are working and visible.

Simulate login/signup functionality using localStorage or similar (front-end only).

Persona Quiz

Implement a multi-page quiz flow with “Next” and “Back” buttons.

Fully responsive and mobile-friendly.

Show instant persona result at the end (e.g., “You are The Explorer”).

Profile Section & Dashboard

Create a user dashboard visible after login.

Include a profile page with editable fields like name, email, learning goals.

Show user's quiz result, tips, and recommended tools/courses.

Navigation Bar

Fix broken dropdown functions.

Make all links, dropdowns, and navigation buttons fully responsive.

Only show logged-in features after successful login simulation.

L&D Professionals Section

Make this section functional with:

Upload employee data (mocked or simulated)

Show persona distribution by department

Generate downloadable PDF reports or mockups

Sign Up / Multi-Page Support

Add multiple HTML pages (or dynamically render sections).

Ensure Sign Up/Login pages redirect correctly to dashboard or home.

📦 Summary:
NO React or TypeScript

Use only HTML + CSS + JavaScript

Modular, maintainable, and fully functional across devices

Focus on UI/UX, responsiveness, interactivity, and clean code
